<p>To use the Service you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Application.  Bubl does not warrant that the Application will be compatible with your mobile device.  If you decide to use the Service, subject to your agreement and compliance with these Terms and the Privacy Policy, Bubl hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use an object code copy of the Application on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you.  Bubl also grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited scope license to access and use those portions of the Service that are not part of the Application.  Use of the Service shall be solely for your own, private, non-commercial purposes and for no other purpose whatsoever. If the Service or any part thereof is determined to be illegal under the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are situated, you shall not be granted any license to use the Application or any other part of the Service, and must refrain from using it.</p>

<p>You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Application; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Application to any third party or use any part of the Service to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Application; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Service, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Service, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Service; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on any part of the Service.

You acknowledge and agree that Bubl is not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Bubl does not control nor is it obligated to review, research, verify, validate or approve the third-party sites to which the Service may be linked.

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." If you are a resident of any other jurisdiction that requires a similar waiver for the foregoing release to be enforceable, you hereby waive any applicable statutes of that jurisdiction.</p>

You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all User Content that you make available on or through the Service. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content that you make available through the Service or that you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases that are necessary to grant to Bubl the rights in such User Content as contemplated under these Terms; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal of the User Content or Bubl's use of the User Content (or any portion thereof) on, through or by means of the Service will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

You hereby agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Bubl shall at no time be responsible or held liable for the removal, modification or blocking of material or User Content that may be considered offensive and shall at no time be obligated to effect such removal other than under applicable law.</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision (this "Provision”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Bubl. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury. Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and Bubl (as defined below, for this Provision) shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in court, before a judge or jury, and/or participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys' fees). For the purpose of this Provision, "Bubl” means Bubl and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term "Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Bubl regarding any aspect of your relationship with Bubl, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). "Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. YOU AND Bubl EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.

<h3>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h3>

<p>For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Bubl an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to Bubl, 105 S Orlando Ave. #201, Los Angeles, CA 90048. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If Bubl does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.

<h3>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or Bubl may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the "Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to Bubl, 105 S Orlando Ave. #201, Los Angeles, CA 90048. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Bubl through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Bubl. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court. 

<h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>

<p>If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above ("Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or Bubl may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association ("AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision. For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA's Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. 

<p>Arbitration Award—The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement. 

<p>Location of Arbitration – You or Bubl may initiate arbitration in either Los Angeles, CA or the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution. In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution, Bubl may transfer the arbitration to Los Angeles, CA in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator. 

<p>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – Bubl will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Bubl as provided in the section above titled "Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.

<h3>Class Action Waiver</h3>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Bubl specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of this Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of the Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above. 

<h3>Severability</h3>

<p>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.

<h3>Continuation</h3>

<p>This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with Bubl.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Bubl makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require Bubl to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises

<h2>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h2>

<p>These Terms and your use of the Service shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) are specifically disclaimed.  Any action arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be brought only in the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, CA, and you hereby submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bubl may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, without posting bond, to enjoin any breach of these Terms, in addition to any other rights or remedies Bubl may have available at law or in equity.

<h2>Entire Agreement</h2>

<p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Bubl and you regarding the Service, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Bubl and you regarding the Service.

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Bubl's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be of no effect. Bubl may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

<h2>Waiver; Severability</h2>

<p>The failure of Bubl to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Bubl. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
