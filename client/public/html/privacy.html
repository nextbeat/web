<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>Effective Date: October 17, 2014</p>

<p>Bubl, Inc. (“Bubble,” “we” or “us”) values your privacy.  The Bubble mobile application (the “App”) allows users to create dynamic social networks - or “bubbles” – where they can add photos, comments and other content to share with friends within their bubbles.  Generally, bubbles self-destruct after 24 hours.  In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain about users of our App and the services available through our App (collectively, “Services”).</p>

<p>By using our Services, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy. Your use of our Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Policy, as well as  our Terms of Service, which are available <a href="terms.html">here</a> and incorporated by reference into this Policy. </p>

<h2>What Information Do We Collect About You and Why?</h2>

<p>We collect information about you when you use our Services.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>We use your information, including your personal information, for the following purposes:</p>

For example, you can choose to invite your Contacts to use Bubble.  In addition, we will connect you with your Contacts who are also fellow Bubble users, by adding them to your Bubble friends list (you can always delete someone from your friends list).
