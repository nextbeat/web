At Nextbeat, our goal is to provide a platform for fun, safe, intimate connection between creators and their communities. We aspire to be present, to create spaces where all users can feel supported and appreciated, and to promote positivity and tolerance in all Nextbeat interactions. To ensure that our community members can feel safe, we ask our users and creators to respect the following guidelines.

## Illegal Behavior
Copyright violation, breaking and entering, trespassing, causing harm to another person, taking illegal drugs — if it’s against the law, it will get you banned (though if you just published illegal behavior publicly on the internet, you’ve got bigger problems to worry about).

## Violence and Threats
We want our users to feel safe, so don’t threaten anyone with harm! Sarcasm doesn’t come across in text, so even if you’re kidding, you can’t assume that the person you’re talking to understands that you don’t mean it. Please keep things civil.

## Harassment 
Harassment — here defined as any activity that attempts to intimidate, degrade, abuse, or bully others, or which creates a hostile environment for others — will not be tolerated on Nextbeat. Neither will behavior that incites harassment: creators who encourage their users to spam other rooms or to harass other users will be permanently banned, as will anyone participating in their harassment campaigns. 

## Intolerance and Hateful Conduct
Intolerance is never okay on Nextbeat. It doesn’t matter if it was just a joke, your words can be harmful to others and we cannot allow it. Any conduct which encourages or facilitates discrimination, denigration, objectification, harassment, or violence based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, medical condition, or physical characteristics will result in a permanent ban from Nextbeat. Likewise, actively promoting or advertising groups or communities which encourage the harassment, discrimination, objectification or denigration of others (even if you’re not explicitly repeating their messaging) will get you banned.  

## Sharing of Private Information
Never ask another person to share their home address (or specifics of their location), their contact information, their financial info, or anything other personally identifiable information! If you see someone soliciting this information, please report them to us at team@nextbeat.co.

## Unkindness and Disrespect
Be nice, please! Don’t insult another person’s appearance or sense of humor; be supportive and positive toward your fellow humans. Likewise, creating videos that demean or degrade other people is not acceptable on Nextbeat. 

## Impersonation
Creating a misleading account name with intent to masquerade as another person is strictly forbidden. Fan accounts are fun and fine! Just don’t try to convince people that you’re someone you’re not.

## Nudity or Pornographic Activity
Nextbeat is not the place for explicitly sexual content. We support responsible sexual education and support our creators wearing whatever makes them feel comfortable — just please no camming or full nudity. 

## Self-Destructive Behavior
Please don’t harm yourself or promote self-destructive behavior on Nextbeat! This includes encouraging anorexia, disordered eating and other forms of physical self-harm. Be sensitive to what your community members might find triggering – you don’t know what they’ve been through.

## Sales of Illicit Goods
Sales of tobacco, drugs, weapons or ammunitions, coursework or student essays, or products which threaten endangered species are prohibited on Nextbeat.

If you witness any of the above infractions, please report them to us at team@nextbeat.co. We work diligently to keep Nextbeat a friendly, positive and safe space for all our users, and we hope you’ll do the same!
